## A music and money streaming platform. 
Spotify artists can link their crypto wallets to allow fans to directly stream them crypto. As a fan listening to their favorite artist, they can choose their own rate at which to directly stream crypto to their favorite artist (platform takes no cut). This allows a deeper connection between artists and fans and helps the artist make a living off of their art.

- Artists just need to link a crypto wallet to start receiving tips.
- Fans name their price. Choose how much you would like to contribute to your favorite artists!
- Start / Stop tipping at any time

## Under the hood
- Spotify SDK to allow playback from artists already on Spotify. No need to migrate your music to a new platform! 
- Superfluid protocol to allow real time streaming of crypto
